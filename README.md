# GET BROWSER HISTORY

(Work in Progress) So far I can pull browser history for the chrome browser and I am working on manipulating and parsing the outputs (website urls, website titles, timestamps). I'm actively working on shrinking the website urls through rebrandly's api and I've converted the timestamps to datetime objects with the datetime library to make further manipulation easier and less time consuming.
